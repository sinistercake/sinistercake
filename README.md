- 👋 Hi, I’m @sinistercake (Jaime)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... healthcare systems administration, systems integration via HL7 & FHIR, working with *that* EMR you're thinking of. Windows server administration & endpoint management, IRL & in the cloud. Powershell power hell. Learning software development so I can one day escape this inferno.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... what the heck is devops anyway? GO, SQL, linux server administration, networking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... casual conversation
- 📫 How to reach me ... ja.castro516@outlook.com
